						<p>July 23, 2063.<br><br></p>
  
						<p>It was a warm Friday morning. Harper Winchester wiped the beads of sweat off her face as she wrapped up the finishing touches of her latest project. The relentless, muggy heat of July had left her covered in an uncomfortable layer of grease and sweat, yet the satisfaction of finally completing the time machine left her scarcely aware of the physical discomfort.<br><br></p>
						 
						<p>It was almost a month since Harper discovered an old piece of parchment in her attic while trying to clean out the place. Tucked away quietly in the far corner and covered in a thick layer of dust, it had seemed as if it had been there in hiding since her great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents built this house in the late 1800s. She, driven by her insatiable curiosity, had undusted and unfolded it in an attempt to discover the secrets of the past. However, what she found astounded her, for it wasn’t so much a secret of the past as it was of the future. On one side, the parchment displayed an intricately detailed diagram and instructions on how </p>
					</div>
					<div>

						<p>to build a time machine. Spread out across the back of the parchment was a map of Ford’s Theatre as it was in 1865. Two strings of seemingly indecipherable code were scrawled on the bottom of the page:<br><br></p>
						 
						<p style="text-align:center;"><i>
						21.38.4.14.1865.39.77<br>
						T&CCT60-1.2E-5xP239.<br><br></i></p>
						 
						 <p>For years, Harper had dedicated her time and skills as a mechanic to exploring how to build a time machine. She had studied all of the existing theories of how to implement one, and had pioneered several different methods of constructing one herself. Despite her efforts, Harper was unable to produce any working models, as they all failed for one reason or another. She immediately recognized that the instructions on the parchment for building the time machine detailed a brilliant implementation of wormholes and acceleration that could resolve the problems of existing implementations. Furthermore, the two cryptic lines seemed to resemble something she vaguely remembered had strongly piqued her interest. After thinking about it for some time, Harper decided that she would devote everything to solving the mystery behind the parchment.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Over the past week, she had meticulously followed the final instructions listed on parchment in preparation for the big day, today. On Tuesday, she had visited the Barrows Point Trading Post downtown to purchase a GLOCK 43, the weapon of choice used to . Wednesday, she secured the shipment of the specified 1.2 x 10-5 kg of Plutonium-239 needed to fuel the time machine. Thursday was a day of test runs and final adjustments, which carried over to Friday morning. Now as she surveyed the completed project, she couldn’t help but feel a spark of pride for what she had accomplished thus far. She had managed to successfully construct a machine designed based on a concept from the future, or even from another realm, and one that she definitely did not fully comprehend. It was not an easy feat and she knew it. Satisfied, she wiped her hands on her already-greased shirt and headed back into her house to clean off the grime before she planned to make the much-anticipated journey in a couple hours.</p>
							
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Harper hummed as she passed through the living room, and then bounded up the stairs in a way she hadn’t done since she was a little girl. Surprised by her own enthusiasm, she smiled a little at herself while walking to her room. Upon entering her room, she was shocked with the mess she saw. Her desk was piled high with books and papers from her research on another project she had abandoned for the time being so she could work on the time machine, the foot of her bed was home to a number of clothes she wore once but not long enough to banished to the laundry hamper, and her laundry hamper, of course, was overflowing with many weeks worth of dirty clothes. In a rush to finish her project, Harper had completely neglected cleaning her room. But this could wait. She quickly grabbed her towel and ducked into the bathroom before she could chastise herself even more for her messy room. </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>In the safety of her bathroom, she peeled off her filthy clothing, and sighed contently as the hot water hit her shoulders and started washing away the sweat and grease that had accumulated throughout the morning. As she lathered her hair, her mind drifted and she started thinking about what lay ahead in the afternoon. The mission was clear: prevent the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. But how was she to go about it? She knew the historic facts, that John Wilkes Booth was the perpetrator and that the assassination happened at 10:15 at night during a performance of “Our American Cousin” in Ford’s Theatre on April 14th, 1865. And of course, she knew how to navigate Ford’s Theatre with the map on the back of parchment, but that was the extent of her knowledge of the past. She had memorized the face of John Wilkes Booth from old photographs, but what if he looked different in real life and she mistook someone else for him, or missed him completely? What if she was in the wrong place in the wrong time? She frowned at herself and shook off the worry. Her four years with the marine corps would be enough, she was sure. She had completed missions with just as much or even less information. Going back in time wouldn’t be that much different from going to another country with a different culture. She just had to blend in. The only aspect of the trip that concerned her was that she would be traveling alone because the time travel machine was only built for one person. </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Stop worrying too much, she told herself.</p>
						<p>She couldn’t afford to let her nerves get in the way of her mission, a mission that would change the course of history, maybe ameliorate the reconstruction era, potentially advance de facto and de jure voting rights for African Americans, perhaps reduce the current racist attitudes--the possibilities were endless. She would let nothing stop her from completing the mission, but one thing remained certain: she would not open fire or murder Booth if she didn’t have to because she couldn’t justify the murder of a person with only malicious intent yet had done nothing wrong. Other than that, however, she was intent on preventing the assassination and knew that she had the ability to do so. She just needed to find Booth, and everything else would fall into place, she told herself. </p>
						
						<p>You can do this. </p>
						
						<p>And then she surrendered herself to the steamy shower.</p>
						
						<p>Thirty minutes later, Harper emerged from her house and strode into the garage, ready to take on the mission. With the parchment sitting safely in the back pocket of her pants and her gun tucked snugly in its holster, she stepped into the time machine and sunk into the single plush seat. She felt herself relax and silently thanked herself for having the foresight to add cushions to her seat. Harper closed the portal and secured herself into the machine. She fastened herself onto the seat, then closed her eyes and breathed deeply for a minute. When she opened her eyes again, they were steeled with determination and her jaw was set. She felt the familiar spike of adrenaline that she had missed so much and felt her senses sharpen. She was ready.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<p>Harper took out the piece of parchment and set it on the dashboard. Glancing between the keypad and the parchment, she entered the spacetime coordinates into the machine, and started the engine. Her face was emotionless as she felt the machine come to life.</p>
						<p>Here goes nothing. </p>
						<p>The time machine accelerated for five full minutes, and then suddenly, the whirring of the engine died down and came to a stop as quickly as it had started up.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>April 14th, 1865</p>

						<p>Harper waited for the last piece of machinery to quiet down, and then gingerly exhaled, unaware that she had been holding her breath for a while. She unclenched her fingers from the armrests, knuckles white from exertion and adjusted her seating. She sat in the machine for a little longer, then reached upward and popped open the portal. </p>
						
						<p>Immediately, she felt the sting of a cold gust of wind. </p>
						
						<p>Damn it.</p>
						
						<p>Rookie mistake: she was underdressed. Foolishly, she had forgotten to plan for an uncharacteristically cold mid-April evening.</p>
						
						<p>Harper sighed. This is going really well. </p>
						
						<p>She folded the piece of parchment and slipped it into her back pocket. Bracing herself for the cold, she clenched her jaw and climbed out of the time machine. She winced as she again felt the cold wind whip across her bare arms. The scene she found herself in was in stark contrast to where she had been merely five minutes ago. Night had fallen and she estimated that the temperature was somewhere in the high 30s. In her jeans and tank top, she unexpectedly found herself mourning the loss of the muggy, sweat-inducing july heat. She was in the middle of a narrow, deserted street surrounded by small shops and town houses. In the distance, she could see the outline of Ford’s Theatre against the full moon. She glanced around and found a perfect hiding spot for her time machine, right behind a giant dumpster in a small alley. Harper silently thanked whoever recorded the spacetime coordinates for the superb choice of location as she pushed the machine behind the dumpster and started walking in the direction of Ford’s Theatre. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<p>Footsteps. She whipped her head around in alarm and braced for self-defense. A young boy in breeches and a wool coat walking on the other side of the street glanced at her, then had a double take as his eyes traveled below her face. He quickly glanced at her face again, this time with a little bit of fear, and hurried down his path, glancing backward once before disappearing across a corner. Confused, Harper looked down at her clothes. The way he looked at her made her feel like she had forgot an article of clothing, say, perhaps, her pants, but last she checked, she was wearing both her tank top and her jeans. And then it hit her. She had completely forgotten to dress for the era. Cursing at herself again, she ducked into another alley. Looking around, she spotted a window on the ground level, and peaked in. Surprisingly, it was a woman’s living quarters. Berating herself for what she was about to do, Harper slipped her fingers under the window and pulled up, praying that the window would budge. To her surprise and relief, it slid upwards with little more than a couple of creaks, and she deftly slipped into the empty room.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>The room was small but cozy. Just enough moonlight filtered in through the sole window to illuminate the room. A large rug covered most of the wooden floorboards and the walls were decorated with pale, floral wallpaper. The bed was pushed against one of the walls, creating a space on the opposite side of the room for a gracefully carved wooden chair with plush seating and a vanity littered with bottles and containers of makeup and perfume. Harper quickly located the wardrobe situated next to the vanity, eased open the wooden doors, and examined its contents. The first thing that caught her eye was an ostentatiously puffy floor length gown booby-trapped with lace and ruffles. Sweet baby jesus. Next to it was a visibly less gaudy gown, also floor-length, in a modest color. Exactly which shade, she couldn’t tell in the dark. After a moment’s decision, Harper reached for the </p>
