						<p><i>June 19, 1963.<br>
						Massachusetts, USA</i><br><br></p>
  
						<p>Harper Winchester dusted off her shirt as she finished moving a stack of dusty, heavy tomes to the attic. The books had been sitting in the study for a while, and were starting to take up too much space as new books were purchased and placed in the study. Finally, she had found time to clean and reorganize the small room.<br><br></p>
						 
						<p>As she stood up, Harper noticed a folded piece of parchment next to a stack of older books that had been sitting in the attic for as long as she could remember. Tucked away quietly in the far corner and covered in a thick layer of dust, it seemed as if it had been in hiding since her great-great-great grandparents built this house in the late 1800s. How had she never seen this before? Driven by her insatiable curiosity, she dusted off and unfolded the thinning piece of paper in an attempt to discover the secrets of the past. However, what she found astounded her, for it wasn’t so much a secret of the past as it was of the future. On one side,</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>the parchment displayed an intricately detailed diagram and instructions on how to build a time machine. Spread out across the back of the parchment was a map of Ford’s Theatre as it was in 1865. Two strings of seemingly indecipherable code were scrawled on the bottom of the page:<br><br></p>
					
						<p style="text-align:center;"><i>
						21.35.4.14.1865.39.77<br>
						T&CCT60-1.2E-5xP239.<br><br></i></p>
						 
						<p>For years, Harper had dedicated her time and skills as a mechanic to exploring how to build advanced machinery. She immediately recognized that the instructions on the parchment for building the time machine detailed a brilliant design and was compelled to pursue it. Furthermore, the two cryptic lines seemed to resemble something familiar. After thinking it over for some time, she realized that the first line detailed the coordinates for the time and destination of travel, and the second detailed the supplies needed for the journey - a special watch, and the substance to be used for fuel. With her interest strongly piqued, Harper decided that she would try to solve the mystery behind the parchment.<br><br></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p><i>July 24, 1963.<br>
						Massachusetts, USA<br><br></i></p>

						<p>It was a warm Friday morning. Harper wiped the beads of sweat off her face as she wrapped up the finishing touches of her latest project. The relentless, muggy heat of July had left her covered in an uncomfortable layer of grease and sweat, yet the satisfaction of finally completing the time machine rendered her scarcely aware of the physical discomfort.<br><br></p>
						<p>During the last month, Harper had tried and failed repeatedly until finally succeeding in reconstructing the time machine from scratch. She had reached many stumbling blocks along the process, but she never once waivered. At the same time, she figured out that the elements in the parchment would enable her to carry out one specific mission: to prevent the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.  As she made progress building the time machine, she grew more passionate about what the parchment entailed and became even more determined to carry out its instructions.<br><br></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Last week, Harper had meticulously followed the final instructions listed on parchment in preparation for the big day, today. On Tuesday, she had visited the Barrows Point Trading Post downtown to purchase a TC-CT60, a very special watch that would be able to survive the time travel journey. Wednesday, she secured the shipment of the specified 1.2 x 10-5 kg of Plutonium-239 needed to fuel the time machine. Thursday was a day of test runs and final adjustments, which carried over to Friday morning. Now as she surveyed the completed project, she couldn’t help but feel a spark of pride for what she had accomplished thus far. She had managed to successfully construct a machine designed based on a concept from the future and one that she definitely did not fully comprehend. It was not an easy feat and she knew it. Satisfied, she wiped her hands on her already-greased shirt and headed back into her house to clean off the grime before she planned to make the much-anticipated journey in a couple hours.<br><br></p>
						<p>Harper hummed as she passed through the living room, and then bounded up the stairs in a way she</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>hadn’t done since she was a little girl. Surprised by her own enthusiasm, she smiled a little at herself while walking to her room. Upon entering her room, she was shocked with the mess she saw. Her desk was piled high with books and papers from her research on another project she had abandoned for the time being so she could work on the time machine, the foot of her bed was home to a number of clothes she wore once but not long enough to be banished to the laundry hamper, and her laundry hamper, of course, was overflowing with many weeks worth of dirty clothes. In a rush to finish her project, Harper had completely neglected cleaning her room. But this could wait. She quickly grabbed her towel and ducked into the bathroom before she could chastise herself even more for her messy room.<br><br></p>
						<p>In the safety of her bathroom, she peeled off her filthy clothing, and stepped into the shower. Sighing contently as the hot water hit her shoulders, Harper started washing away the dirt that had accumulated throughout the morning. As she lathered her hair, her mind drifted and she started thinking </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>about what lay ahead in the afternoon. The mission was clear: to prevent the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. But how was she to go about it? She knew the historic facts, that John Wilkes Booth was the perpetrator and that the assassination happened at 10:15 at night during a performance of “Our American Cousin” in Ford’s Theatre on April 14th, 1865. She could also navigate Ford’s Theatre with the help of the map on parchment, but that was the extent of her knowledge of the past. Furthermore, even though she had memorized the face of John Wilkes Booth from old photographs, what if he looked different in real life and she mistook someone else for him, or missed him completely? What if she was ended up in the wrong place in the wrong time? She frowned at herself and shook off the worry. Her two years with the marine corps would be enough, she was sure. She had completed missions with just as much or even less information. Going back in time wouldn’t be that much different from going to another country with a different culture. She just had to blend in.<br><br></p>
					</div>
					<div>
							<p><i>Stop worrying too much, she told herself.</i> <br><br></p>
							<p>She couldn’t afford to let her nerves get in the way of her mission, one that would change the course of history, ameliorate the reconstruction era, potentially advance de facto and de jure voting rights for African Americans, perhaps reduce the current racist attitudes-the possibilities were endless. She would let nothing stop her from completing the mission, but one thing remained certain: she would not open fire on Booth if she didn’t have to. Other than that, however, she was intent on preventing the assassination and knew that she had the ability to do so. She just needed to find Booth, and everything else would fall into place, she told herself. After reassuring herself that everything would work out, she surrendered herself to the steamy shower.<br><br></p>
							
							<p>Thirty minutes later, Harper emerged from her house and strode into the garage, ready to take on the mission. With the parchment sitting safely in the back pocket of her pants and her gun tucked snugly in its holster, she stepped into the time machine and sunk into the single plush seat.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
							<p>She felt herself relax and silently thanked herself for having the foresight to add cushions to her seat. Harper closed the portal and secured herself into the machine. She fastened herself onto the seat, then closed her eyes and breathed deeply for a minute. When she opened her eyes again, they were steeled with determination and her jaw was set. She felt the familiar spike of adrenaline that she had missed so much and felt her senses sharpen. She was ready.<br><br></p>
						
							<p>Harper took out the piece of parchment and set it on the dashboard. Glancing between the keypad and the parchment, she entered the spacetime coordinates into the machine, and started the engine. Her face was emotionless as she felt the machine come to life.<br><br></p> 
							
							<p>Here goes nothing.<br><br></p>
							
							<p>The time machine accelerated for five full minutes, and then suddenly, the whirring of the engine died down and came to a stop as quickly as it had started up.<br><br></p>
							
					</div>
					<div>
							<p>April 14th, 1865<br>
							Washington D.C., USA<br><br></p>
							
							<p>Harper waited for the last piece of machinery to quiet down, and then gingerly exhaled, unaware that she had been holding her breath. She unclenched her fingers from the armrests and with knuckles white from exertion, adjusted her seating. The trip had taken significantly less time than she had expected, and she sat in the machine for a while to recover and gather her wits. Once she regained normal breathing, she reach down and adjusted the hands on her watch so that it would match the time on the dashboard of the time machine. The special watch could survive the time travel journey, but that was the extent of its power. She still had to manually adjust it to fit the time that she was in. Satisfied with where the hands of her watch were set, she pushed the knob on the side of the watch and let it continue its ticking. Then with a final deep breath, she reached upward and popped open the portal.<br><br></p> 
							
							<p>Damn it. <br><br></p>
					</div>
					<div>
							<p>Immediately, she felt the sting from a cold gust of wind. Even though it was mid-April, the weather was devastatingly chilly, which Harper didn’t plan for at all. She folded the piece of parchment and slipped it into her back pocket. Bracing herself for the cold, she clenched her jaw and climbed out of the time machine. She winced as she again felt the cold wind whip across her bare arms. The scene she found herself in was in stark contrast to where she had been merely five minutes ago. Night had fallen and she estimated that the temperature was somewhere in the low 30s. In her jeans, short-sleeved shirt, and sneakers, she unexpectedly found herself longing for the sweat-inducing july heat. She was in the middle of a narrow, deserted street surrounded by small shops and town houses. In the distance, she could see the outline of Ford’s Theatre against the full moon. She glanced around and found a perfect hiding spot for her time machine, right behind a giant dumpster in a small alley. Harper silently thanked whoever recorded the spacetime coordinates for the superb choice of location as she pushed the machine behind the dumpster and started walking in the direction of the theatre.<br><br></p>
					</div>
					<div>	
							<p>Footsteps. Harper whipped her head around in alarm and braced for self-defense. A young boy in breeches and a wool coat walking on the other side of the street glanced at her, then had a double take as his eyes traveled below her face. He quickly glanced at her face again, this time with a little bit of fear, and hurried down his path, glancing backward once before disappearing across a corner. Confused, Harper looked down at her clothes. The way he looked at her made her feel like she had forgot an article of clothing, say, perhaps, her pants, but last she checked, she was wearing both her tank top and her jeans. And then it hit her. She had completely forgotten to dress for the era. Cursing at herself again, she ducked into another alley. Looking around, she spotted a window on the ground level, and peaked in. Luckily for her, it was a woman’s living quarters. She checked her watch. 9:42. She had a little bit of time. Berating herself for what she was about to do, Harper slipped her fingers under the window and pulled up, praying that the window would budge. To her surprise and relief, it slid upwards with little more than a couple of creaks, and she deftly slipped into the empty room.<br><br></p>
					</div>
					<div>
							<p>The room was small but cozy. Just enough moonlight filtered in through the sole window to illuminate the room. A large rug covered most of the wooden floorboards and the walls were decorated with pale, floral wallpaper. The bed was pushed against one of the walls, creating a space on the opposite side of the room for a gracefully carved wooden chair with plush seating and a vanity littered with bottles and containers of makeup and perfume. Harper quickly located the wardrobe situated next to the vanity, eased open the wooden doors, and examined its contents. The first thing that caught her eye was an ostentatiously puffy floor length gown booby-trapped with lace and ruffles. Sweet baby jesus. Next to it was a visibly less gaudy gown, also floor-length, in a modest color. Exactly which shade, she couldn’t tell in the dark. After a moment’s decision, Harper reached for the dress that was…<br><br></p>
