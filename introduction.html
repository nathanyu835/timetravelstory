						<p>July 23, 2063.</p>
  
						<p>It was a warm Friday morning. Harper Winchester wiped the beads of sweat off her face as she wrapped up the finishing touches of her latest project. The relentless, muggy heat of July had left her covered in an uncomfortable layer of grease and sweat, yet the satisfaction of finally completing the time machine left her scarcely aware of the physical discomfort.</p>
						 
						<p>It was almost a month since Harper discovered an old piece of parchment in her attic while trying to clean out the place. Tucked away quietly in the far corner and covered in a thick layer of dust, it had seemed as if it had been there in hiding since her great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents built this house in the late 1800s. She, driven by her insatiable curiosity, had undusted and unfolded it in an attempt to discover the secrets of the past. However, what she found astounded her, for it wasn’t so much a secret of the past as it was of the future. On one side, the parchment displayed an intricately detailed diagram and instructions on how to build a time machine. Spread out across the back of the parchment was a map of Ford’s Theatre as it was in 1865. Two strings of seemingly indecipherable code were scrawled on the bottom of the page:</p>
						 
						<p style="text-align:center;"><i>
						21.38.4.14.1865.39.77<br>
						G43-1.2E-5xP239.</i></p>
						 
						 <p>For years, Harper had dedicated her time to exploring how to build a time machine. She had studied all of the existing theories of how to implement one, and had pioneered several different methods of constructing one herself. Despite her efforts, Harper was unable to produce any working models, as they all failed She immediately recognized that the instructions for building the time machine detailed a brilliant implementation of wormholes and acceleration that could resolve the problems of existing implementations. and the two cryptic lines that seemed to resemble something she vaguely remembered had strongly piqued her interest. </p>

						<p>Today we will create an animated portfolio gallery with jQuery.
							The gallery will contain a scroller for thumbnails and a
							content area where we will display details about the portfolio
							item. The image can be enlarged by clicking on it, making
							it appear as an overlay.</p>

						<h1>Annotation Overlay Effect</h1>
						<p>Today we will create a simple overlay effect to display annotations in e.g. portfolio
							items of a web designers portfolio. We got the idea from the wonderful
							portfolio of www.rareview.com where Flash is used to create the
							effect. We will use jQuery.</p>

						<h1>Bubbleriffic Image Gallery</h1>
						<p>In this tutorial we will create a bubbly image gallery that
							shows your images in a unique way. The idea is to show the
							thumbnails of albums in a rounded fashion allowing the
							user to scroll them automatically by moving the mouse.
							Clicking on a thumbnail will zoom in a big circle and
							the full image which will be automatically resized to
							fit into the screen.</p>
