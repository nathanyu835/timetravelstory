						<p><i>I’m doing this woman a favor by removing this from her closet</i>, she thought, then winced at the half-assed attempt at a justification. Also, a dress is a small price to pay for changing history for the better.<br><br></p>
						<p>Sighing, Harper slipped out of her comfortable clothes, and wriggled into the dress. She struggled with the buttons and the skirt for a while, but eventually was able to arrange them so that the dress sat decently on her body. She forgot that she had lost considerable weight since her marine years, and was surprised to find that the dress was a little too big on her. She frowned--it would have to do. She carefully folded her jeans and shirt and placed it at the foot of the bed as somewhat of a poor substitute for a deposit, hoping that at the end of the night, she would have a chance to return the dress. She felt ridiculous with the absurd amount of ornamentation on the dress, but at least she would fit in more at the theater than she would have in her tighter clothing. Thankfully, the ruffles were large enough to hide her sneakers, so she didn’t have to “borrow” another item of clothing. </p>

					<div>	<p>Not expecting to use the gun unless absolutely necessary, she wrapped the holster around her thigh and slipped the gun in place. The big skirt was a perfect cover; no one would ever suspect a thing. As for the piece of parchment, she wanted easier access. She pursed her lips, then decided to hide it in the folds of her dress. It was light enough that it would stay in place, but was still very much within reach at a moment’s notice.<br><br></p>
						<p>Satisfied, Harper plucked a woolen shawl off a hook on the wall, turned around to climb out of the window, then froze. She groaned inwardly. Climbing into the room in pants was one thing. Climbing out of the room in a big, frilly dress was a completely different story. She glanced at her watch. 9:52. She wouldn’t have time to take off the skirt, climb out, then put it on again. Annoyed at her slip-ups and the amount of time it cost her, Harper walked briskly to the window and in one smooth motion and hoisted herself onto the window sill, attempting to make up for lost time. So far, so good. However, as she turned to her side and placed her left leg outside the window, a gust of wind rustled</p>

Frantic, Harper extracted herself from the window, almost tearing the dress in the process, and stumbled into the alley. She could see the piece of parchment flying further and further away. She ran after it back onto the street. To her dismay, she watched as the wind blew the parchment in the opposite direction, away from Ford’s Theatre.<br><br></p>
						<p><i>Just my luck.</i><br><br></p>
