						<p>There was invaluable information on that piece of paper that she could not afford to lose, not to mention the map that would be her guide for the mission tonight. If she did not get the parchment, she knew that she had very little chance of succeeding at her mission and she would lose the instructions for the time machine. Chastising herself for not having the foresight to make a copy of the parchment, Harper picked up speed and sprinted after the parchment, determined to retrieve it. But the faster she ran, the higher the parchment flew as it was blown gust after gust after gust of wind.<br><br></p>

						<p>One block. Two blocks. Three blocks. A right turn. Two more blocks. Turn left. One block. A left turn. Three blocks turn right. <br><br></p>
						
						<p>It didn’t take long for Harper to realize that she wasn’t as fit as she used to be and that the chase was turning into an uphill battle. She watched hopelessly as the parchment fluttered higher and higher into the night, and for once, she forced herself to accept the fact that maybe this time, determination would not be enough to get her </p>
					</div>
					<div>	
						<p>what she needed. That was hard to swallow. The parchment was gone. Permanently gone.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>And then a scarier thought hit her. In the frenzy of the chase, she had completely forgotten about the time. How much time had she spent chasing this one piece of paper? She snuck a glance at her watch. 10:07.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>God help me.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>Harper turned and sprinted back the way she’d come. Turn left then three blocks. Turn right this time. Then one block. Then turn right. Two more blocks, then a left turn? Or was it right? She swore she had followed the same path she took, but she still wasn’t able to spot Ford’s Theatre among the multitude of buildings in Washington D.C. <br><br></p>
						
						<p>Finally, she saw the peak of the theater’s roof rise slightly above the other buildings. Still blocks away. <br><br></p>
						
						<p>10:10.<br><br></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Pumping arms, sweat beading at her neck and dripping down the side of her face. <br><br></p>
						
						<p>10:11.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>Closer. Closer. Three blocks away. <br><br></p>
						
						<p>10:12.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>Faster, faster. You can do it. <br><br></p>
						
						<p>10:13<br><br></p>
						
						<p>The building is in view. The double doors grow bigger. She reaches for the gun tucked under layers of skirts, strapped onto her thigh. Strange looks, annoyed faces. <br><br></p>
						
						<p>10:14<br><br></p>
						
						<p>5 feet away. 4 feet away. 3. 2. 1. On the steps. Harper reaches for the door handle...<br><br></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>10:15<br><br></p>
						
						<p>Bang!!<br><br></p>
						
						<p>The shot was heard around the block. Harper froze, paralyzed with anguish as she fought down the scream that was building up inside of her. I failed.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>5 seconds.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>10 seconds.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>A bloodcurdling scream fills the night as a figure leaves the theater and dashes into the night.<br><br></p>
						<p>10:16<br><br></p>
						
						<p>On the other side of the city, the had wind finally died down and had gently deposited a piece of parchment on a balcony beside a man with graying hair but gentle eyes before dancing away into the night. The man picked up the parchment and</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p> looked at it, eyes widening as the implications of its contents slowly dawns on him. But he knew it wasn’t time yet. <br><br></p>
						
						<p>Years later, the man moved north to Massachusetts. He oversaw the construction of a house that would provide shelter for generations to come, and happily settled there with his children and grandchildren until his peaceful death 10 years later.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>As he was sorting through the will, the man’s eldest son came across a piece of parchment with strange diagrams and maps. He squinted at the contents, then sighed in slight exasperation. He knew that his father loved to dream and hypothesize, but this was taking it too far. Nevertheless, in his father’s memory, he stored it lovingly in a box, along with several other letters that he had received from his father throughout the years, and placed the box in the study.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>Time danced pass and soon, the man’s grandson had grown up. One day, the grandson was cleaning out the study when he came across a box. He opened </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>it to find a stack of letters and a piece of parchment filled with an intricate diagram and a map. Puzzled, he took out the piece of parchment, studied it, and then snorted as comprehension of its contents dawned on him. He removed the letters and placed them with another stack of letters his father had kept, and took the piece of parchment, along with several books that would not fit in the small study, to the attic. He dropped the books and parchment off in a corner, dusted off his hands, then went back to the study to continue cleaning it out.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>And there, the parchment had sat waiting, until one day, Harper carried a stack of dusty, heavy tomes up to the attic. The books had been sitting in the study for a while, but were starting to take up too much space as new books were purchased and placed in the study until finally, she had found time to clean and reorganize the small room.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>As she stood up, she noticed a folded piece of parchment next to a stack of older books that had been sitting in the attic for as long as she could remember. Tucked away quietly in the far corner and covered in a thick layer of dust, it seemed as if it had been in hiding since her great-great-great grandparents built this house in the late 1800s...<br><br></p>
						<p>THE END.<br><br></p>
