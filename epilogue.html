						<p>July 25, 1963.<br>
						Massachusetts, USA.<br><br></p>

						<p>Ring Ring Ring. Harper shut off her alarm, stretched lazily, and then laid down on her bed again. She was exhausted from what had happened yesterday, and once again began to ruminate over the events that had unfolded. She had tried to prevent the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Yet despite months of careful planning, she was unable to complete her mission.<br><br></p> 
						
						<p>After Harper had failed yesterday, she retraced her steps and snuck back into to the living quarters where she had borrowed the dress. She changed back into her own clothing, and carefully put the dress back just as she had found it. She then went to the alley where she had hidden the time machine, walked past the large dumpster, and sat down inside of the machine. After cursing herself for her mistakes, she entered the coordinates from where she had left and traveled back to the present.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>When she arrived back, she braced herself for all of changes that could have happened throughout the world as a result of her actions. Harper had heard of the Butterfly Effect before, and was prepared for the worst. However, when she got out of the time machine, everything felt was exactly the way she had left it. Maybe the change just didn’t effect my immediate surroundings, she thought. She proceeded to do a thorough check of historical events online, but was surprised to find that nothing seemed to have change to the extent of her knowledge, not even regarding the events concerning the assassination of Lincoln. Since then, she had run the events from beginning to end in her head over and over again. Even now laying in her bed, she still couldn’t wrap her mind around why nothing at all had changed.<br><br></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Maybe I can’t change the past.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>Harper sat up as this thought crossed her mind. That’s it!, she thought to herself. She couldn’t really explain it, but this seemed to be the only possible resolution to her concerns. After concluding that it is impossible to change the past even by traveling to the past, she threw on some clothes, stomped down the stairs, and destroyed her time machine in a massive acid bath of H3O.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>August 23, 1963.<br><br></p>
						
						<p>Over a month had passed since Harper had destroyed her time machine. During this time, she had conducted a lot of research on the theories of time travel and had read the works of many leading scholars. Eager to share her knowledge but wanting to remain anonymous, she then penned a letter to David Lewis about her thoughts and theory on time travel restraints. She left the letter unsigned. Four years later, Lewis published “The Paradoxes of Time Travel” in 1967, writing to the world that it is impossible to change the past. Almost half a century later, Nathan Yu and Angela Liu listen carefully as Professor Binkoski analyzes Lewis’ essay at Dartmouth College...<br><br></p>
