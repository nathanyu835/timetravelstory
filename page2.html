                            <p>seemed to resemble something she vaguely remembered had strongly piqued her interest. 

For the last six months, she had tried and failed and tried and failed and then finally succeeded in reconstructing the time machine from scratch. 

Over the past week, she had meticulously followed the final instructions listed on parchment in preparation for the big day, today. On Tuesday, she had visited the Barrows Point Trading Post downtown to purchase a GLOCK 43, the weapon of choice used to . Wednesday, she secured the shipment of the specified 1.2 x 10-5 kg of Plutonium-239 needed to fuel the time machine. Thursday was a day of test runs and final adjustments, which carried over to Friday morning. Now as she surveyed the completed project, she couldn’t help but feel a spark of pride for what she had accomplished thus far. She had managed to successfully construct a machine designed based on a concept from the future, or even from another realm, and one that she definitely did not fully comprehend. It was not an easy feat and she knew it. Satisfied, she wiped her hands on her already-greased shirt and headed back into her house to clean off the grime before she planned to make the much-anticipated journey in a couple hours.

She hummed as she passed through the living room, and then bounded up the stairs to her room in a way she hadn’t done since she was a little girl. Her enthusiasm surprised her and she smiled a little at herself. Entering her room, she decided that she had perhaps neglected it a little too much in her rush to finish the project. Her desk was piled high with books and papers from her research on another project she had abandoned for the time being so she could work on the time machine, the foot of her bed was home to a number of clothes she wore once but not long enough to banished to the laundry hamper, and her laundry hamper, of course, was overflowing with many weeks worth of dirty clothes. But this could wait. She quickly grabbed her towel and ducked into the bathroom before she could chastise herself even more for her messy room. 

In the safety of her bathroom, she peeled off her filthy clothing, and sighed contently as the hot water hit her shoulders and started washing away the sweat and grease that had accumulated throughout the morning. As she lathered her hair, her mind drifted and she started thinking about what lay ahead in the afternoon.
