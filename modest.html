						<p>She didn’t want to deprive the woman, whoever it was, of the extravagant gown if that was what she preferred. She slipped the dress off of the hook and noticed that it came with a sash.<br><br></p>

						<p>Perfect! She thought, I’ll fasten the parchment with the sash!<br><br></p>
						<p>The gown was relatively easy to slip on, though the buttons in the back took her a while. It fit surprisingly well. Satisfied, she tugged on the dress to smooth it out. She then tied the sash to her waist and tucked the parchment underneath it so that it was snug and secure. Next, she buckled the gun holster to her thigh so that it would be concealed. Wincing, she carefully folded her jeans and shirt and placed it at the foot of the bed as somewhat of a poor substitute for a deposit, hoping that at the end of the night, she would have a chance to return the dress. <br><br></p>
						
						<p>She then turned around to climb back onto the street. Thankfully, the dress was easy to move in and proved no difficulty as she maneuvered through </p>

							the window. Harper gracefully hopped off the window ledge, then checked to see if both her gun and the piece of parchment was there. They were both securely in place. Everything was going pretty well so far. She checked her watch. 9:50. 25 minutes until the assassination. <br><br></p>
						<p>	I’d better be on my way.<br><br></p>
							
						<p>	She walked briskly through the cold night, shivering slightly each time a gust of wind rustled her dress. In hindsight, she wish she had thought to borrow a shawl or a coat of some sort. <br><br></p>
						<p>	You’ll survive, she told herself.<br><br></p>
							
						<p>	With her eyes on Ford’s Theatre, she quickly traversed the few blocks that separated her landing place and the theater. She kept her face expressionless as she neared the theater and walked up the steps to the main entrance. She snuck a glance at her watch. 10:05. She had a little bit of time.<br><br></p>
					</div>
					<div>		
						<p>	Walking through the front doors, Harper took in the lobby of the theater. It was smaller than she had anticipated, but still grand in its own way. </p>
						<p>
							It opened up to the left of the main entrance, and an intricately designed chandelier brought light to the space. On the very far end was a winding staircase that led up to the Dress Circle level of the theater, which was where the entrances to state boxes were. <br><br></p>
						<p>	That’s where I need to go.<br><br></p>
							
						<p>	As she slowly made her way across the floor towards the staircase, she pulled out the piece of parchment and studied the map of the theater. There was a small, red “x” mark on a small room to the right of the main stage. <br><br></p>
							
						<p>	This must be Lincoln’s state box, she realized.<br><br></p>
							
						<p>	Then halfway up the stairs, Harper heard footsteps behind her. She turned around, and immediately recognized the familiar face that appeared in</p>

						<p>textbooks across the nation. It was John Wilkes Booth himself. He hurried up the steps and gave her a curt nod as he passed her on the staircase. She forced a small smile back.<br><br></p>	
						
						<p>	This is it. <br><br></p>
						
						<p>	Harper quickened her steps slightly, trying not to draw attention to herself. When she reached the top of the stairs, Booth was nowhere in sight, but she knew where to go. She crossed the floor of the Dress Circle lobby, and quietly slipped into the door on the very right after making sure that there was no one behind her. <br><br></p>
							
						<p>	She crossed the dark, carpeted hallway, and arrived at the door to the state box. The door was cracked open, no doubt from Booth’s entrance. She took one more glance at her watch. 10:13. She entered the state box quietly and closed the door behind her. Looking around, she spotted Booth standing quietly in near the back of the state box, not too far from where she was standing. Lincoln, his wife, a young army officer, and his fiancée were sitting in ornately carved plush chairs facing the main stage. Everyone was laughing merrily, unaware of the would-be murderer that had just entered the state box. As her eyes adjusted, she slowly walked in Booth’s direction, intending to talk him out of his plans. <br><br></p>
					</div>
					<div>		
						<p>	However, as she neared Booth, she accidentally brushed up against one of the curtains near the wall, jostling it in the process. She froze, but it was too late. Booth stiffened in response as he, too, noticed movement in the curtains. He whirled around, and saw Harper who was still frozen mid-walk. In one big step, he closed the distance between them, his hands held up as if ready to strike.<br><br></p>
							
						<p>	Does this count as an emergency?<br><br></p>
							    
						<p>	Harper unfroze and decided to defend herself with her...<br><br></p>
