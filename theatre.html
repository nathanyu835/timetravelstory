						<p>There was no time to try to chase after the piece of parchment. Even giving herself 20 minutes to run to the theater, find Booth, and thwart his plans was cutting it too close. She was just going to have to figure out how to navigate the theater without the map. <br><br></p>

						<p>	As she walked as fast as she could towards the theater without tripping on the pretentious dress, she silently sent a thank you prayer to Pierre L’Enfant for making navigation in the city so effortless. Everything was laid out in a grid-like fashion, and there were no dangers of being accidentally trapped in a dead end down a winding alley. All she had to do was go towards the theater, and she knew that she would come across the building on one street or the other. After crossing a few blocks, she arrived at the entrance of Ford’s Theatre, breathless. People gave her strange looks--for her dress or her breathlessness she didn’t know--but she ignored them and strode into the theater like nothing was wrong even though she could feel her heart pounding in her ears. As she walked through the front doors, she quickly took in</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>the lobby. It was smaller than she had anticipated, but still grand in its own way. It opened up to the left of the main entrance, and an intricately designed chandelier brought light to the lobby. On the very far end was a winding staircase that led up to the Dress Circle level of the theater, where the entrance to Lincoln’s state box was. This was it. She was almost there. Now she just had to find Booth somewhere in the theater and stop him before he assassinated President Lincoln. It was weird to think that Lincoln was alive and well, right now, that what she had learned as history was about to unfold in front of her very eyes and that she was very much a part of it. But she pushed the thought away; she would sit on that later. Right now, she couldn’t afford to be distracted. She again felt the adrenaline kick in as her senses sharpened and she scanned the room for Booth. The show “Our American Cousin” had already started, so the lobby was mostly empty except for a few loiterers and ushers. She casually strolled towards the left end of the lobby and climbed the grand staircase as fast as she could while still appearing elegant. She checked her watch. 10:07. 8 minutes until the assassination was supposed to happen.<br><br></p>
							
						<p>	Then in the corner of her eye, she spotted movement. She turned towards the far left corner of the lobby, where she saw a man in a formal suit walk briskly then disappear behind one of the doors. <br><br></p>
							
						<p>	No one enters a play this late. He has to be John Wilkes Booth. <br><br></p>
							
						<p>	Harper quietly loitered around the second floor lobby for a minute to reduce suspicion before slowly making her way across the floor and slipping behind the same door. Distant sounds of laughter reached her ears before she had fully registered her surroundings. She found herself in a long, dark hallway with carpeted floors and walls. In the distance, there was a little bit of light that seemed to be emanating from the state box. She hurriedly followed the light, thankful that the carpeting masked her footsteps, and soon found herself at the doorway of the state box. The door was slightly ajar, so she widened it just a little further to let her dress pass through, and quietly stepped into the state box. <br><br></p>
							
						<p>	As her eyes adjusted to the light, she counted a total of four heads, but something wasn’t right. Her vision adjusted even more, and she realized what was wrong. All four of the people in the state box were men, yet Lincoln was documented as being with his wife, a young army officer, and his fiancée in historical accounts. The man she thought was Booth had joined the three other men in his chair, set facing the stage like all the other chairs, and was laughing merrily along with his friends. <br><br></p>
							
						<p>	This is the wrong state box. I followed the wrong person.<br><br></p>
							
						<p>	All the blood drained from her face. She looked down at her watch, and in the dim light, made out the time. 10:14. One minute until the assassination. She shuffled along the back of the state box until she found a better view of the rest of the theater, and peaked out into the grandeur. On the other side, she spotted an identically set state box, with four silhouettes. Two males and two females. Lincoln and the officer, Mary and the officer’s fiancée. And then she saw him. <br><br></p>
							
						<p>	In the state box across the theater, the real Booth slowly raised the gun and aimed it at his target. Anger racked his frame as he thought of how the Civil War had destroyed his hometown, killed people he loved, turned his family members against one another. <br><br></p>
							
						<p>	For all this suffering, you will pay.<br><br></p>
							
						<p>	Harper held her watch up to her face as she watched the second hand tick slowly towards the 12. The four men in front of her, as well as the Lincolns, oblivious to what was about to take place, were still laughing heartily at the comedic production. Tick. Tick. Tick. 10:15.<br><br></p>
							
						<p>	I’m too late.<br><br></p>
							
						<p>	A shot rang out and reverberated across the theater walls. Confusion. And then piercing the mass of voices was a bloodcurdling scream. Mrs. Lincoln. From afar, Harper saw a figure jump out of the state box, stumble, then run across the stage, out the exit, and into the night.<br><br></p>
							
						<p>	From where she stood, Harper saw history unfold before her eyes. History that she tried to change. History that refused to be changed. History that would never be changed.<br><br></p>
